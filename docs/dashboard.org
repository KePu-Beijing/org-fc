~M-x org-fc-dashboard~ shows a buffer with statistics for review
performance and cards / card types.

[[file:images/dashboard.png]]

The dashboard is divided into several collapsible sections. Some are
visible from the start, while others can be opened on demand.

This saves screen space and computing time (since the contents of
closed sections are only computed when they are opened) while allowing
quick access to different types of statistics.

A marker at the beginning of each section indicates whether it is
currently selected (o), open (-), or closed (+).

The currently selected section can be toggled (closed or open) with
the =Tab= key. The next or previous section can be selected with the =n=
and =p= keys.

=r= starts a review for the selected context and =q= closes the
dashboard buffer.

* Review History

The review history is calculated based on the [[file:review_history.org][Review History]]. Only
cards with a box >= ~org-fc-stats-review-min-box~ (default: 0) are
included.

Setting this to a higher value (e.g. 2) excludes the first few
"learning" reviews of a card.
