#+TITLE: Custom Spacing Algorithms

The interfaces defined by this package should be flexible enough to
allow implementing custom review spacing algorithms.

This is not possible at the moment because the awk scripts and the
functions for reading / updating the review data drawer make strong
assumptions about the format of the review data.

A good implementation of this should allow using different spacing
algorithms based on a ~:FC_SPACING:~ property in the card.

There are more advanced / complicated algorithms that could be
implemented (SM5, MPI).

In the years I've been using this algorithm, I've averaged a
forgetting rate of ~6.8% on cards outside of the learning phase (box
>= 2).

I think the main benefit would be a decreased review frequency / density.
I'm not sure the added complexity is worth this.
