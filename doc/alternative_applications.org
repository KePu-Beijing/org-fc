#+TITLE: Alternative Applications

While the primary application is learning information using spaced
repetition, at the end, the API should be flexible enough to implement

addition to the next date.

One example would be storing one exercise per heading, using the
positions to store one or more sets and logging the number of
repetitions done on each "review".
